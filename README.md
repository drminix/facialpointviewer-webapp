# Real-time facial keypoint detection using CNN

Live Demo: https://drminix.github.io/projects/facialpointdetection/index.html

This github repo contains the source code for the real-time facial point detection application using VGG-16 network. [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection/) for facial keypoints detection has been used to train the network. Two real-time key point detection applications have been implemented using this ML model. These are (1) desktop application and (2) web application. This repo contains the source code for the web application. Please visit this page for desktop application: https://github.com/drminix/facialpointviewer

Web application is written in JavaScript, Tensorflow.js, and OpenCV.js
